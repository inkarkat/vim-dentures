I have attempted to design this plugin such that it is easy to extend. Feel
free to open issues and pull requests on GitHub (link in README). When making
changes to the code, please:

* Try to be consistent with the coding style of the plugin
* Make sure your commit messages are nicely formatted
* Avoid commits that change too much at once
* Avoid commits that fix things broken in previous commits by...
* Avoid commits that break things

# Thank You

thank you.
