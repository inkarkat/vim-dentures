INTRODUCTION                                    *dentures*

In addition to helping old people chew food, "dentures" is a playful term I 
made up for indentation |text-objects|, and is also the name of this plugin.

TEXT OBJECTS                                    *dentures-text-objects*

Dentures introduces the following |text-objects| to your crusty old Vim, all
of which are available in |visual-mode| and |Operator-pending-mode|:

                                                *dentures-ai* *v_ai* *ai*
ai                      "an indent", select surrounding lines with greater or
                        equal indentation, delimited by blank lines. Leading
                        or trailing blank lines are included in the selection.

                                                *dentures-ii* *v_ii* *ii*
ii                      "inner indent", select surrounding lines with greater
                        or equal indentation, delimited by blank lines.

                                                *dentures-aI* *v_aI* *aI*
aI                      "an INDENT", select surrounding lines with greater or
                        equal indentation, including blank lines between and
                        leading or trailing blank lines.

                                                *dentures-iI* *v_iI* *iI*
iI                      "inner INDENT", select surrounding lines with greater
                        or equal indentation, including blank lines between.

                                                *dentures-CTRL-V*
                                                *dentures-blockwise*
When any of the above |text-objects| are invoked from |blockwise-visual| mode,
the selection will begin at the first non-blank character of the first
selected line. Try it; you'll like it. (See |blockwise-operators|)

TAKE A BITE                                     *dentures-and-you*

The best way to wrap your head around dentures is to take a bite; try out each
of the |text-objects| introduced by this plugin for yourself. Great care has
been taken to behave in a way that is consistent with other |text-objects|.
