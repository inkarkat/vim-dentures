# Contributing

I have attempted to design this plugin such that it is easy to extend. Feel
free to open issues and pull requests on GitHub (link in README). When making
changes to the code, please:

* Be consistent with the coding style of the plugin
* Make sure your commit messages are nicely formatted
* Avoid commits that change too much at once or break things on their own

# Thank You

No, really; to anyone who spends any time helping to improve this plugin:
thank you.
